# Getting Started With React
The purpose of this guide is to get you familiar with the bare necesseties of React in order to get developing

Follow these step-by-step guides to be competent enough to get stuff on the screen

## Who is this for?
Very beginner oriented. This guide assumes 0 familiarity with React, and only a basic knowledge of JavaScript. It also assumes little to no experience with the ES6 syntax of JavaScript

## Don't Be Annoying
This guide is very much a 10,00ft view. If something is off, feel free to reach out and tell me, however understand that some of the more complex topics can be simplified by omitting certain things.

This isn't to say you should build bad habbits, but skipping over some intricacies isn't going to permanently hinder someone's ability to use React.

## N00bz: 
If you're here, learn. Google stuff, ask questions, don't assume that any one guide has it all. Multiple perspectives and opinions are critical to forming your own.
