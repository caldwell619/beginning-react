# Intro
In this section we will be talking about boring stuff. If you don't care about unecessary React informtion feel free to [skip]() this section


## Why should I learn this? 
The world of frontend web development is rapidly evolving. There is no one size fits all solution when it comes to a frontend framework ( Angular, Vue.js, and React being the big 3 ). However different their implementation may be, the core ideas remain very similar. In summary, get with the times.

## What is a framework, and how is it different than a libray?
Im oh so glad you asked

### Framework
A (web) framework is a predefined set of code bases that you adhere to in order to do common functions. These are generally very opinionated ( rigid, my way or the high way ), and can be thought of much like a MadLib. There are spots for you to interject your own adjectives, verbs, and nouns, but for the most part, the rest is structured.

### Library
A libray can be thought of a piece that makes up a framework. Likely the most common example is jQuery. A bunch of really common, often complex actions in JavaScript that are simplified to `$('.className').slideToggle()`. 

React definies itself as a library. [Seriously](https://reactjs.org/). 

### TL;DR
It comes down to both being code that other people wrote, that we will use to accomplish our own goals
